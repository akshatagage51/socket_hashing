This program is related to hashing technique.Hashing technique used here is linear probing.


In this program, all the packets are hashed in hash table based on its source ip,destination ip,source port,destination port and protocols.
If a packet is arrived from same 5 ip tuppels it will update the time stamp.

To lookup for particular packet, send lookup message from client.
To delete a packet send delete message from client.

To run the server use make to create excutable and the run the excutable
eg
make
./server

To run the client_tcp and client_udp do make and run the executable.
Also write the ip address and port no to which you have to connect.

make
./client_tcp <ip_address> <port_no>
./client_udp <ip_address> <port_no>
eg
./client_tcp 192.168.131.32 8888

./client_udp 192.168.131.32 8888

To check for memory leaks enter:
./client_tcp 192.168.131.32 -v

./client_udp 192.168.131.32 -v

./server -v
