I have created a server which distinguish between Tcp and Udp packet.
If a packet comes it checks first whether this packet has been received from same 5 ip tuppel parameters ie source ip address,destination ip address,source port no,destination port no and protocol.
if yes,then it simply update the packet and if not it will insert that packet in hash table.
if collision occurs it will go to next index as it is using linear probing technique.
